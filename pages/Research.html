<font size="3">Patient vs. provider incentives for malaria care in Kenyan pharmacies: A cluster randomized controlled trial </font> <br>
<br>
Malaria afflicts 190 million people in sub-Saharan Africa each year, with children, pregnant women, and the poor bearing the brunt of the burden. 
Nearly all deaths and serious illness are preventable through available, effective, and inexpensive medication, and clinical guidelines clearly recommend testing prior to treatment. 
Despite this, most malaria cases are undiagnosed, resulting in a gap between treatment and need: missed diagnoses result in avoidable illness, and over-prescription of antimalarials 
can lead to drug resistance. Most malaria patients seek care at pharmacies, where I hypothesize that the mismatch between diagnosis and treatment reflects a misalignment of patient 
and provider incentives. In this paper, I investigate how realigning patient and provider incentives to diagnose suspected malaria cases prior to treatment can improve malaria 
case management. Building on prior work on the impact of subsidies for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and malaria treatments, I test whether targeted incentives for RDTs and first-line 
antimalarials only to malaria-positive cases will improve treatment targeting through increasing test result adherence. Using a cluster randomized trial design in 140 pharmacies in 
malaria-endemic zones in Kenya, I randomize patient discounts and pharmacist performance incentives and compare their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to the status quo standard of care. 
Pharmacies were randomized to a status quo control group or one of three treatment groups using a digital malaria case management tool: (1) patient discounts for RDTs and first-line antimalarials 
conditional on a positive test; (2) pharmacy incentives for selling RDTs to diagnose fevers and for selling first-line antimalarials conditional on a positive test; and (3) patient discounts and 
pharmacy incentives for RDT use and first-line antimalarial use for confirmed malaria-positive cases. This design allowed us to evaluate the impact of two part incentive structures as well as to 
examine the causal effect of targeting that incentive to the patient (demand-side) or the provider (supply-side). Preliminary findings from ~80 sites suggest that subsidies and incentives for diagnostic 
testing increase usage of testing and may nudge malaria positive individuals to purchase high quality antimalarials and improve treatment targeting. Data collection is ongoing until early 2022, 
and analysis is in progress. <br>

<font size="3"> Increasing access to contraceptive choice through targeted incentives </font> <br>
<br>
We investigate how targeted subsidies for long-acting injectable contraception and provider incentives impact initial uptake, sustained adoption, pricing and stocking decisions for contraceptive products in local markets, sales, and user health outcomes. 
Following prior work on the effectiveness of subsidies to promote the adoption of new technologies and experience goods, we aim to test if subsidies lead to sustained adoption of injectable contraception as well as to study possible mechanisms for continued usage 
(or lack of) such as learning, price anchoring, and information effects. We propose a market-level cluster randomized controlled trial in 140 pharmacies in Kenya to answer these questions. 
Patient subsidies and pharmacist incentives will be cross-randomized and compared against the status quo to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting sustained adoption. Funding has been obtained.

<font size="3">Extreme weather, parental investments, and child health in Madagascar</font> <br>
<br>
Using panel microdata on household inputs and child health outcomes and high-resolution gridded climate data from Madagascar, I investigate 
how weather-induced income shocks affect parental investments and child nutrition and cognition outcomes. In particular, I explore the link 
between maternal depression and child investment decisions at critical developmental stages.

<font size="3"> Integrating early stimulation and play at scale: Mahay Mikolo cluster RCT in Madagascar </font> <br>
<br>
Programs to promote nurturing and responsive caregiving, such as those in which community health workers (CHWs) conduct home visits to 
support optimal early child development (ECD), have been effective in small trials, but have not achieved similar success at scale. 
This study will explore two approaches to scale-up: converting a home-visiting model to a group-based model; and integrating the ECD 
curriculum into an existing government program.  The objectives of the study are to: 1) Measure how the integration of ECD activities 
affects time and task allocation of CHWs and CHW psychosocial wellbeing; 2) Examine how the integration of ECD activities affects 
caregiver-child dyad participation in standard health and nutrition activities; and 3) Explore how the availability of age-appropriate 
play materials at home affects caregiver-child dyad participation rates in a group-based ECD program. Collaborators are Lia 
C.H. Fernald, Emanuela Galasso, Ann Weber, Caitlin Barkume, and Lisy Ratsifandrihamanana.
