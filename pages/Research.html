<font size="3">Testing digitally targeted incentives for malaria case management </font> <br>
<br>
We investigate the impact of targeted subsidies for malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and treatment at the point of sale on demand, 
sales and stocking decisions, and patient health outcomes using a novel digital platform in Kenya in a cluster-randomized control trial. 
Following prior work on the impact of subsidies for RDTs that finds that incentives increase testing but do not improve medication targeting, 
We test whether subsidies targeted to pharmacists or patients through a digital platform will increase diagnostic testing and improve 
medication targeting. Collaborators on this work are Paul Gertler and Jonathan Kolstad. 
Field work is ongoing, and this project has received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID. <br>

<font size="3">Extreme weather, parental investments, and child health in Madagascar</font> <br>
<br>
Using panel microdata on household inputs and child health outcomes and high-resolution gridded climate data from Madagascar, I investigate 
how weather-induced income shocks affect parental investments and child nutrition and cognition outcomes. In particular, I explore the link 
between maternal depression and child investment decisions at critical developmental stages.

<font size="3"> Integrating early stimulation and play at scale: Mahay Mikolo cluster RCT in Madagascar </font> <br>
<br>
Programs to promote nurturing and responsive caregiving, such as those in which community health workers (CHWs) conduct home visits to 
support optimal early child development (ECD), have been effective in small trials, but have not achieved similar success at scale. 
This study will explore two approaches to scale-up: converting a home-visiting model to a group-based model; and integrating the ECD 
curriculum into an existing government program.  The objectives of the study are to: 1) Measure how the integration of ECD activities 
affects time and task allocation of CHWs and CHW psychosocial wellbeing; 2) Examine how the integration of ECD activities affects 
caregiver-child dyad participation in standard health and nutrition activities; and 3) Explore how the availability of age-appropriate 
play materials at home affects caregiver-child dyad participation rates in a group-based ECD program. Collaborators on this work are Lia 
C.H. Fernald, Emanuela Galasso, Ann Weber, Caitlin Barkume, and Lisy Ratsifandrihamanana.
