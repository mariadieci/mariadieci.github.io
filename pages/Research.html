<font size="3">Designing Incentive Contracts to Improve the Diagnosis and Treatment of Malaria </font> <br>
<br>
We examine whether a diagnosis contingent incentive contract structure improves the diagnosis
and appropriate treatment of malaria, and whether demand or supply incentives for rapid tests
(RDTs) and high quality antimalarials (ACTs) only to malaria positive cases better promote
socially-optimal antimalarial use. Using a cluster randomized trial design we randomize pa-
tient subsidies and pharmacist performance incentives. We find that both patient subsidies and
provider incentives increase RDT testing uptake by 25 percentage points, on average, and lead
to significant improvements in appropriate antimalarial use, largely due to malaria negative
patients opting out of taking unnecessary malaria medication. The increase in ACT purchase
appears to be concentrated among those that find out that they are malaria positive. However,
the reduction in ACT purchase is concentrated in the group that finds out that they were
malaria negative and in the incentivized treatment groups. This suggests that the reduction in
ACT purchase is driven by a combination of patient specific diagnosis information and incen-
tives. We find evidence that patient subsidies and provider incentives operate through different
channels: patient subsidies result in significantly lower RDT prices paid by patients, while
provider incentives induce pharmacists to provide more comprehensive counseling. Finally, we
find that all three incentive interventions are cost-effective approaches to improve appropri-
ate antimalarial use in pharmacies. Taken together, these results suggest that appropriately
calibrated and targeted financial incentives are promising for changing patient and provider
behavior, with implications for quality of care.

<font size="3"> Provider Agency and Health Technology Adoption: How Financial Incentives Impact the Uptake of a New Contraceptive </font> <br>
<br>
We investigate how targeted subsidies for long-acting injectable contraception and provider incentives impact initial uptake, pricing and stocking decisions for contraceptive products in local markets, sales, and user health outcomes. 
Following prior work on the effectiveness of subsidies to promote the adoption of new technologies and experience goods, we aim to test if subsidies lead to sustained adoption of injectable contraception as well as to study possible mechanisms for continued usage 
(or lack of) such as learning, price anchoring, and information effects. We condcuted a market-level cluster randomized controlled trial in 140 pharmacies in Kenya to answer these questions. 
Patient subsidies and pharmacist incentives will be cross-randomized and compared against the status quo to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting sustained adoption. Data collection complete.

<font size="3">Extreme weather, parental investments, and child health in Madagascar</font> <br>
<br>
Using panel microdata on household inputs and child health outcomes and high-resolution gridded climate data from Madagascar, we investigate 
how weather-induced income shocks affect parental investments and child nutrition and cognition outcomes.

<font size="3"> Integrating early stimulation and play at scale: Mahay Mikolo cluster RCT in Madagascar </font> <br>
<br>
Programs to promote nurturing and responsive caregiving, such as those in which community health workers (CHWs) conduct home visits to 
support optimal early child development (ECD), have been effective in small trials, but have not achieved similar success at scale. 
This study will explore two approaches to scale-up: converting a home-visiting model to a group-based model; and integrating the ECD 
curriculum into an existing government program.  The objectives of the study are to: 1) Measure how the integration of ECD activities 
affects time and task allocation of CHWs and CHW psychosocial wellbeing; 2) Examine how the integration of ECD activities affects 
caregiver-child dyad participation in standard health and nutrition activities; and 3) Explore how the availability of age-appropriate 
play materials at home affects caregiver-child dyad participation rates in a group-based ECD program. Collaborators are Lia
