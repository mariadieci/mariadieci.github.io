#### <u>A Digital Approach to Targeted Malaria Treatment</u>
* We investigate the impact of targeted subsidies for malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and treatment at the point of sale on demand, sales and stocking decisions, and patient health outcomes using a novel digital platform in Kenya. Following prior work on the impact of subsidies for RDTs that finds that incentives increase testing but do not improve medication targeting, we test whether subsidies targeted to pharmacists or patients through a digital platform will increase diagnostic testing and improve medication targeting. Our findings will contribute to the literature on the use of subsidies and digital technology on targeted treatments.

### <u>Understanding determinants of parental investments in early childhood health </u>
* Using panel microdata on household inputs and child health outcomes from Madagascar, I investigate how income shocks affect parental investment decisions and their subsequent impact on child nutrition and cognition outcomes.
