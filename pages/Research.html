<font size="3">Testing digitally targeted incentives for malaria case management </font> <br>
<br>
I investigate the impact of targeted subsidies for malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and treatment at the point of sale on demand, 
sales and stocking decisions, and patient health outcomes using a novel digital platform in Kenya in a cluster-randomized control trial. 
Following prior work on the impact of subsidies for RDTs that finds that incentives increase testing but do not improve medication targeting, 
I test whether subsidies targeted to pharmacists or patients through a digital platform will increase diagnostic testing and improve 
medication targeting. This project has received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID, and is in pilot stages. <br>

<font size="3">Extreme weather, parental investments, and child health in Madagascar</font> <br>
<br>
Using panel microdata on household inputs and child health outcomes and high-resolution gridded climate data from Madagascar, I investigate 
how weather-induced income shocks affect parental investments and child nutrition and cognition outcomes. In particular, I explore the link 
between maternal depression and child investment decisions at critical developmental stages.
