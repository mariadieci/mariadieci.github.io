I am a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in global health and development economics, broadly defined, in low-resource settings. <br /> 

My current work focuses on understanding the role of digital healthcare technology in improving access to high-quality care, and understanding determinants of parental investments in early childhood health.  <br /> 

I've been involved in research projects throughout Africa and Latin America, and conducted field work in Zambia, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Before graduate school, I worked at Innovations for Poverty Action in Zambia and in New Haven evaluating health and social safety net programs.
