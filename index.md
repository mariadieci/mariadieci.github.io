Welcome! Starting in August 2022, I will be an Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Management at Emory Rollins School of Public Health. I received my PhD in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in health policy, global health and development economics. <br /> 

My current work focuses on understanding the role of targeted incentives in improving coordination between patients and providers for high quality care, and understanding parental investments in early childhood health.  <br /> 

I've been involved in research projects throughout Africa and Latin America, and have conducted field work in Kenya, Madagascar, Zambia, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Before graduate school, I worked at Innovations for Poverty Action in Zambia and in New Haven evaluating health and social safety net programs in the US and abroad. <br />
